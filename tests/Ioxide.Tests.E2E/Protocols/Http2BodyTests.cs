/// Streamed HTTP/2 response bodies over a REAL server: a real reactor, a real TcpConnection and its
/// write slab, and a real HTTP/2 client reading the body back.
///
/// The shape under test is a static file server's: headers inside the dispatch pass, a park on the
/// file read, then the body pushed as bounded chunks with a flush after each - because the producer
/// copies into a fixed buffer and must drain it before staging the next slice.
///
/// Everything is asserted on the RECEIVED BYTES. A response that loses its body still emits
/// well-formed HEADERS and END_STREAM, so it arrives as a clean 200 of length zero; only comparing
/// content catches it. The in-process queue tests (Ioxide.Tests.Unit) drive the same shapes through
/// a fake pipe and pass, so anything that fails here and not there is the transport, not the
/// framing.
