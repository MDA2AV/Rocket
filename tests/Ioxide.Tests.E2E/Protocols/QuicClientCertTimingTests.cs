/// <summary>
/// WHEN a QUIC peer counts as authenticated, as distinct from whether its chain validated.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The native shim (<c>ioxide_ngtcp2_shim.c</c>, <c>iq_verify_certificate</c>) flips
/// <c>peer_authenticated</c> the moment the client Certificate message validates - before
/// CertificateVerify has proved possession of the private key and before the client Finished. The
/// managed accessors (<see cref="QuicEngineConnection.PeerSubject"/> /
/// <see cref="QuicEngineConnection.PeerCommonName"/>) gate on the connection being alive, not on the
/// handshake being complete, and the application holds the connection object from the accept path,
/// which fires pre-handshake.
///
/// The concern is that an identity could be read from a connection whose handshake has not
/// completed. This pass tried to observe exactly that and could not: on the single-threaded reactor
/// the whole Certificate-through-Finished window lives inside one <c>iq_conn_read</c> call, no
/// application-reachable hook fires during it (the h3 handler parks on stream data, which needs
/// 1-RTT keys; 0-RTT is unreachable because the shim installs no ticket encryptor), and the C
/// accessors themselves gate on <c>peer_authenticated</c>, which is unset at every point the
/// application can read. So there is no PEND here - the window is genuine in the native layer but
/// not observable through any supported, deterministic surface.
///
/// What is committed instead pins the reachable half of the guarantee: the identity is absent when
/// the application first holds the connection (the accept/handler-launch point, before the client
/// has even been asked for a certificate) and present only once the handshake has completed. A
/// regression that recorded the identity earlier - at accept, in <c>iq_accept</c>, or by dropping
/// the <c>peer_authenticated</c> gate on the accessors - would turn the accept-time read non-null
/// and fail this test. It does NOT prove the sub-handshake window is closed; nothing deterministic
/// can, and that is stated so the guard is not mistaken for more than it is.
