/// Stream credit over a long-lived connection: the allowance a closed stream returns, and what
/// happens when a connection outlives its initial_max_streams.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Reviewed for the failing-test pass. The suspected defect - iq_cb_stream_close forgetting to
/// call ngtcp2_conn_extend_max_streams_bidi/_uni, wedging a kept-alive connection after 1024
/// bidi / 100 uni streams - could NOT be reproduced: the shim replenishes correctly, and so does
/// the connection-level flow-control window (initial_max_data, 1 MiB) via extend_max_offset in
/// iq_cb_recv_stream_data. What WAS true is that nothing in the suite pinned any of it: every
/// existing test opens a handful of streams, and the load tests open a new connection per
/// request, so deleting the replenishment left the whole suite green. These tests pin it.
///
/// All three were proven able to fail: with the extend_max_streams_bidi/_uni and
/// extend_max_offset calls NOP-patched out of a scratch copy of libioxide_ngtcp2.so, the bidi
/// test wedges at exactly 1024 opened / stream #1025 unopenable, the uni test at 100 / #101
/// (open error -206, STREAM_ID_BLOCKED), and the window test on the stream that crosses 1 MiB
/// ("send wedged after 1000 KiB cumulative") - while the OTHER 109 tests of this suite all
/// stayed green, which is the review finding these exist to close.
///
/// The limits live in iq_accept (initial_max_streams_bidi = 1024, _uni = 100, initial_max_data =
/// 1 MiB) and are not configurable, so the bidi test really does run 1064 streams; it stays fast
/// by pipelining a bounded window of streams over one connection. Internal deadlines are
/// progress-based (a stall, not slowness, is what fails), well inside the runner's watchdog.
///
/// Not coverable from here: a stream RESET rather than closed cleanly also funnels into ngtcp2's
/// stream_close (where the replenish lives), but the shim exports no client entry point that
/// sends RESET_STREAM/STOP_SENDING, so that path cannot be driven without editing the harness.
