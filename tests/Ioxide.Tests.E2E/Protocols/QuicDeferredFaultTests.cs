/// The deferred-fault machinery: a callback that throws, a recv queue that overflows, and whether
/// either is acted on rather than merely recorded.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Eight [UnmanagedCallersOnly] callbacks cross from ngtcp2 into managed code, and an exception
/// reaching that boundary aborts the PROCESS - there are native frames between it and any managed
/// caller. So each is guarded, the reason goes to <c>_deferredFault</c>, and EndEngineCycle acts on
/// it once ngtcp2's frames have unwound (tearing down inside the callback would free the connection
/// out from under the ngtcp2 call still on the stack below it).
///
/// Every test here therefore asserts three separate things, because each of the three plausible
/// mutations breaks a different one: the process and its reactor survive (delete a guard, or tear
/// down inside the callback, and they do not), the peer is TOLD - a CONNECTION_CLOSE, which the
/// client's ngtcp2 reports back as DRAINING (ignore the deferred fault and it hears nothing at all),
/// and a LATER connection is still served, since a test that only checks the faulting connection
/// passes just as well with the reactor dead.
