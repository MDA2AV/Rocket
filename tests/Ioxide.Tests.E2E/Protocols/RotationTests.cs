/// <remarks>
/// Harder than the TCP side and tested more carefully for it: OpenSSL refcounts a context, so a
/// connection holding one keeps it alive. picotls does not - it reads the context for as long as
/// the connection lives - so a generation is published whole and the one it replaced is kept rather
/// than freed. The load test below is the one that would crash if that were wrong.
