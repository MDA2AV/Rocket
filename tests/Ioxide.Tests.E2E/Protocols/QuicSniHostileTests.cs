/// <summary>
/// SNI as a hostile client can shape it: repeated extensions, a second ClientHello after a
/// HelloRetryRequest, and names that are legal but odd.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Every test here drives the server with a hand-built ClientHello rather than with the in-tree
/// client, because no client in this tree can send the shapes under test - and the shim's defence
/// against them (<c>iq_count_host_names</c>, a hand-written TLS parser walking attacker-controlled
/// bytes) was therefore never once executed by the suite.
///
/// <see cref="RawInitial"/> is what makes that possible: it encrypts one QUIC Initial packet with
/// keys derived from the destination connection ID, so the ClientHello inside it is whatever bytes
/// this file says it is, and it decrypts the server's Initial packets back - which is enough to see
/// a ServerHello, a HelloRetryRequest, or a CONNECTION_CLOSE. It deliberately stops there: reading
/// the certificate would need the handshake keys, and nothing here has to.
///
/// Each refusal is paired with a control that differs in ONE field, so "the server refused" cannot
/// be satisfied by a hello this file simply got wrong. That pairing is also what stands in for
/// breaking the thing under test: nothing here can edit the shim, so what makes the two-name
/// refusal mean something is that the same hello with one host_name - and the same hello whose
/// second list entry is of another name_type - are both served by the same server.
///
/// No test asserts WHICH alert was sent, because the shim cannot carry one: it closes with
/// ngtcp2_ccerr_set_liberr(NGTCP2_ERR_CRYPTO), which infers PROTOCOL_VIOLATION, so every TLS alert
/// this server raises reaches the peer as the same code. What is asserted is the branch taken -
/// closed, retried, or answered - which is the part the alert would only have annotated.
