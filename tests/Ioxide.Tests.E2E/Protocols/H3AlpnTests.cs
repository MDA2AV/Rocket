/// <summary>
/// ALPN as HTTP/3 requires it, and what the negotiated protocol reads back as. RFC 9001 section
/// 8.1 makes ALPN mandatory for QUIC (no mutual protocol = no_application_protocol, during the
/// handshake); RFC 9114 section 3.1 makes "h3" the token an HTTP/3 server may serve.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Two behaviours in this area were examined and could NOT be driven from this suite, so they are
/// recorded here rather than half-tested:
///
/// - Server preference order with a multi-token offer (the shim's iq_on_client_hello walks the
///   allowlist on the outside, so the server's order decides, like the TCP side's
///   AlpnNegotiationTests pins). The shim's client entry points hand picotls exactly ONE token -
///   a single iovec, count = 1 - so no in-tree client can offer several protocols at once.
///
/// - The negotiated token reading back as nothing when it exceeds the 64-byte read-back buffer
///   (iq_conn_get_alpn returns 0 when the token does not fit the buffer
///   QuicEngineConnection.HandshakeCompletedOnce hands it). A legal ALPN token may be 255 bytes,
///   but the shim's client stores its offer in a char[64] via snprintf, truncating it to 63 - so
///   the shortest token that would trip the server's cap cannot be offered from here. The 63-byte
///   test below pins the longest reachable token instead.
