/// The shim keeps a verified peer's identity in <c>char peer_subject[1024]</c> and
/// <c>char peer_cn[256]</c>, and a name that does not fit is recorded as no name at all. That is
/// the right instinct - a truncated DN is a prefix two different principals can share, and one
/// string standing for two principals is the one thing an identity must never do - but it is only
/// half applied, and nothing tells the caller it happened:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>the same certificate is named in full by TLS over TCP, which caps nothing
/// (<c>TlsSession.RenderSubject</c> hands back whatever <c>X509_NAME_oneline</c> rendered), so one
/// client is alice on 443 and anonymous on 443/udp - the certificate the first test below mints
/// reports its whole 1456-byte subject through <c>Handlers.TlsIdentity</c> on the TCP stack, and
/// null here;</item>
/// <item>null is documented as "the peer offered none", which for a connection the server only
/// accepted BECAUSE a certificate verified is untrue;</item>
/// <item>the two accessors disagree with each other on one connection, which is what the tests
/// below assert on - no second stack required to see it;</item>
/// <item>and the rule is not even the same in both directions: <c>iq_copy_subject</c> truncates a
/// recorded name to the caller's buffer while <c>iq_conn_peer_cn</c> returns 0 for one that does
/// not fit, under a comment claiming it follows "the same rule as the subject".</item>
/// </list>
///
/// None of this is a bypass: a name that is dropped fails closed, and a server requiring client
/// certificates still refuses everyone it refused before. It is a correctness and observability
/// divergence - an application authorizing on <c>PeerCommonName</c> behaves differently on the two
