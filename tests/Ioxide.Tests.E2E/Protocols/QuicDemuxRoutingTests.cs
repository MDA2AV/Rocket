/// What the demux will accept as a routable connection id, before any of QUIC exists.
///
/// The route table is keyed by the DCID the client puts in its long header, and a key that lands
/// there decides which connection every later packet carrying it is fed into. That makes the
/// question "which connection ids may install a route" a transport-safety question, not a parsing
/// one - it is answered in <c>Reactor.QuicDispatchDatagram</c>, above ngtcp2 and above both HTTP/3
/// stacks.
///
/// The apparatus is <see cref="RawInitial"/>, shared with <see cref="QuicSniHostileTests"/>: a real
/// encrypted Initial carrying a real ClientHello, so the server either answers it or does not, and
/// no instrumentation is needed to tell which.

            // by connection id sends one - but it can never legitimately address THIS server:
            // QuicEngine enforces cidLength 1..20, so ioxide never mints one, and nothing it issued
            // can be empty. The demux accepts it anyway (TryExtractDcid takes packet[5] == 0 and
            // returns an empty QuicCid, which is a perfectly good dictionary key), and installs it
            // as a route like any other.
            //
            // ngtcp2 does not stop it either. ngtcp2_accept refuses a short DCID only when the
            // packet carries NO token:
            //
            //     if (pktlen < NGTCP2_MAX_UDP_PAYLOAD_SIZE ||

            // has no Retry path - is enough to walk a zero-length DCID straight through.
            //
            // What that costs: the empty CID is one key, so every later zero-DCID long header from
            // ANY peer routes to whichever connection claimed it first. Initial keys are derived
            // from the client's original DCID, and a second peer sending an empty one derives the
            // same keys - so this is not merely a misdelivery, it is two peers on one connection
