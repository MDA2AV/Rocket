/// The plaintext HTTP/1.1 server the chaos clients attack. A minimal but CORRECT framing loop:
/// accumulate bytes across recvs, answer once per complete request (terminated by CRLFCRLF), and -
/// crucially for chaos - refuse a request whose headers grow past a cap instead of buffering
/// without bound. That last part is what turns a slow-loris or a never-terminated header from an
/// unbounded memory sink into one bounded refusal.
///
/// It frames on end-of-headers and does not read bodies, so a request carrying a large body reads
/// as an unterminated header once the headers are consumed - which the cap then refuses. The tests
/// are written to that model: "large request" means large HEADERS under the cap, and a body-bearing
/// flood is a survival test, not a 200.
