/// Rotation as a client that actually VALIDATES sees it. Split from <see cref="RotationTests"/>,
/// which drives SslStream with verification disabled and asserts on the subject that came back.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The distinction is the point, and it is why these are worth their own file and their own
/// dependency. A test that trusts any certificate proves the server SWAPPED one; it cannot prove
/// the result is something a real client would accept - a chain served in the wrong order, a leaf
/// whose key no longer matches, a certificate published mid-write would all pass it. These drive
/// curl with an explicit CA, so the question becomes "would anyone accept this", which is a
/// different question and the one an operator cares about during a renewal.
///
/// They skip when that curl is absent rather than failing, so the suite stays runnable anywhere -
/// which does mean the strongest rotation assertions in the repo are the ones most likely to be
/// silently absent on a given machine. Worth knowing when reading a green run.
