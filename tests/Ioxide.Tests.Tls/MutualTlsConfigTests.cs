/// Mutual-TLS configurations that must be REFUSED when the service starts.

/// <remarks>
/// Split from <see cref="MutualTlsTests"/>, which is about which clients get in. These are about a
/// service that should never have started: requiring a client certificate with nothing to validate
/// it against, naming two anchor sources, an anchor file that cannot be read, a bundle with a
/// corrupt block in the middle.
///
/// They matter more than the count suggests, because the failure they prevent is silent and points
/// the wrong way. A port that asks every client for a certificate and then accepts whatever it is
/// sent looks authenticated in every log and is not; a trust bundle that stopped loading halfway
/// refuses clients whose only fault is being issued by an anchor further down the file. Each test
/// asserts on the REASON in the message, because a port already in use or a reactor that died on
/// the way up would otherwise report as the refusal being tested.
