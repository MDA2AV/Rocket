/// <summary>
/// TLS 1.3 session resumption: that a returning client is served at all, what its ticket carries,
/// and what a certificate rotation does to one.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Nothing else in this suite resumes anything - every other connection is a fresh full handshake -
/// so every property below was unpinned until now, including one the server explicitly configures
/// for (<c>SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context</c>) and one it states as an invariant in a comment and
/// does not have (a ticket outliving a rotation).
///
/// Resumption is driven with SslStream because it caches sessions per process and offers them for
/// the same target host, which is enough to get a ticket back on the wire without hand-rolling a
/// client. Every test uses a target host of its own: the cache is keyed by that name, so sharing
/// one would let a ticket from a neighbouring test - or from a server this one has already stopped
/// - be the thing offered, and each of these tests asserts on WHICH handshake happened.
///
/// What "resumed" means here is read off the wire rather than inferred, since neither side reports
/// it: the ClientHello carrying a pre_shared_key extension is the client offering its ticket, and
/// the ServerHello carrying one back is the server having accepted it (RFC 8446 4.2.11). Both
/// hellos are plaintext, so a tap on the inner stream can see them. Timing is never consulted.
