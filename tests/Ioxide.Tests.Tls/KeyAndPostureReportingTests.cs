/// Two things a server must not get wrong about its own key and its own handshake.

/// <remarks>
/// From nginx's <c>ssl_password_file.t</c> and <c>ssl.t</c>. The first exists because nginx needed
/// somewhere to put passphrase handling; ioxide has no such API, which makes the question "what
/// happens when someone hands it an encrypted key anyway" rather than "does the feature work". The
/// second is the pair of accessors <c>ioxide.Kestrel</c> maps into ASP.NET's
/// <c>ITlsHandshakeFeature</c>, which applications make authorization decisions on and which
/// nothing tested.
