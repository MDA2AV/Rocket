/// The two sources reach OpenSSL by different doors, which is why the claim is worth testing at
/// all: the path goes through SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations, which parses the bundle with
/// PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio, while the text goes through a PEM_read_bio_X509 loop. Those two readers
/// do NOT accept the same set of blocks, and the difference is silent - a block one of them does
/// not recognise is skipped, not reported.
///
/// The clients are driven with a selection callback that presents the certificate it was handed
/// whatever the server hinted. That is deliberate: the acceptable-CA hint is built by
/// SSL_load_client_CA_file / SSL_CTX_add_client_CA, which is a SEPARATE question from what the
/// store trusts, and neither source hints an anchor it read from a TRUSTED CERTIFICATE block. A
/// client that filtered on the hint would send nothing, and "sent nothing" is indistinguishable at
/// the server from "was not trusted" - so the callback keeps these tests measuring the trust
/// decision rather than a client-side heuristic.
