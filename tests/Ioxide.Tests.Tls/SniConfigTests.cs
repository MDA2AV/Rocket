/// <remarks>
/// Split from <see cref="SniTests"/>, which is about which certificate a name is answered with.
/// These are about a table that should never have been built: a blank name, an entry naming no
/// certificate or two, a file that cannot be read, the same host twice. The failure mode they guard
/// is the one this library treats as the worst kind - a configuration accepted at startup whose
/// effect only shows up as a client being served the wrong certificate, or none.
///
/// Each asserts on the REASON in the message, not merely that starting threw: without that, a port
/// already in use or a reactor that died on the way up reports as the refusal being tested.
