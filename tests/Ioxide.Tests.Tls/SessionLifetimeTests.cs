/// <summary>
/// <see cref="TlsSession"/>'s lifetime: it is a public disposable a user holds, so what its entry
/// points do once <see cref="TlsSession.Dispose"/> has freed the native SSL* and both BIOs is part
/// of its contract - whether stated or not.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Two findings, from probing a real session obtained through the handshake and then poked after
/// disposal (see the DIAG history in git if reproducing):
///
/// 1. Double disposal is SAFE and enforced: the <c>_disposed</c> flag short-circuits the second
///    call, so the SSL* is freed once. Pinned below as an ordinary <see cref="Runner.Test"/> - a
///    regression that dropped the guard would double-free. This is the control: the type DOES guard
///    one thing, which is why the absence of any guard on the rest is a choice, not an oversight.
///
/// 2. Use-after-dispose is NOT refused: <see cref="TlsSession.Write"/>,
///    <see cref="TlsSession.Decrypt"/> and the version getters dereference the freed handles with
///    no disposed-guard. Reproduced below as a <see cref="Runner.Pending"/>. A guarded type would
///    answer with <see cref="ObjectDisposedException"/>; this one runs SSL_write against freed
///    memory and surfaces whatever OpenSSL makes of it.
///
/// A THIRD shape is real but deliberately NOT tested here: Dispose sends a close_notify to a bare
/// stored fd, and a caller that released the connection (recycling the fd through the pool) before
/// disposing would write a TLS record into whatever inherited the number. Every in-repo caller
/// disposes BEFORE DecRef, so nothing exercises it; a test would have to win an fd-reuse race to
/// observe the misdirected write, which is exactly the timing-dependent flake tests/README.md
/// forbids. The guarantee there is conventional (call ordering), not structural (no generation tag
/// on the fd, unlike every reactor-side descriptor) - a note, not a test.
/// </remarks>
