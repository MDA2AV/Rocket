/// negotiation: what the client was told, and what a handler would branch on to pick an h2 loop
/// over an h1 one. The select loop is additionally pinned by reflection for the malformed offers
/// OpenSSL never forwards - that test says why end-to-end cannot deliver them.
///
/// One live defect rides as Pending: BuildAlpnWire casts each UTF-16 unit to a byte, so a
/// non-ASCII protocol name goes on the wire as a DIFFERENT protocol made of its chars' low bytes.
