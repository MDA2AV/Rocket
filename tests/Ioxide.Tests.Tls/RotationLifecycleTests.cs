/// <summary>
/// Rotation as an operation on a RUNNING server, rather than as a call that returns.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The cases here come from haproxy's <c>reg-tests/ssl</c> and nginx's <c>ssl_cache_reload.t</c>,
/// which are worth mining because both projects ship runtime certificate replacement and their
/// regression suites are a catalogue of the ways it goes wrong in production - including two
/// haproxy files named after escaped bugs.
///
/// What separates these from <c>RotationTests</c> is time. Those establish that a rotation changes
/// what the next handshake is served, which is the easy half; every one of them connects AFTER the
/// call returned. These ask what happens to a connection that was already up, to a file rewritten
/// underneath the server, and to a fleet of reactors where a rotation reached only some of them -
/// the situations a renewal actually lands in.
