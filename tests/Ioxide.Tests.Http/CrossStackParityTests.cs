/// <summary>
/// One option, both stacks. Where TCP and QUIC are documented as equivalent and are not.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The two TLS terminations are deliberately separate - OpenSSL under <c>ioxide.tls</c>, picotls
/// under <c>ioxide.ngtcp2</c> - and there is a standing rule against a shared base class, so
/// nothing here argues for unifying them. What it looks for is narrower and worse: an option
/// spelled the same on both, described the same on both, that a deployment can set once and get
/// two different behaviours from. That is what makes a configuration reviewed on one port and
/// unsafe on the other.
///
/// This suite references both stacks, which is why the comparison lives here rather than in
/// <c>Ioxide.Tests.Tls</c> (TCP only) or <c>Ioxide.Tests.E2E</c> (QUIC only). Each stack's own
/// behaviour is covered in its own suite; these tests only ever assert that the two AGREE.
