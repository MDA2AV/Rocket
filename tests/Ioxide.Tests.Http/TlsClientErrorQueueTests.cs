/// One pooled upstream connection's failure affecting another, through state they share by being
/// on the same reactor: OpenSSL's error queue belongs to the THREAD, and SSL_get_error consults it
/// BEFORE asking the SSL whether it merely wants more data.
///
/// The client used to poison that queue on teardown: TlsClientStream.Dispose called SSL_shutdown
/// on a handshake that never finished - which every failed handshake does on its way out - and
/// that call fails and leaves "shutdown while in init" (0A000197) on the reactor's queue. Where
/// the residue lands matters, and it is narrower than the folklore version:
///
///   - a later HANDSHAKE is immune, because OpenSSL's own state machine calls ERR_clear_error at
///     entry - verified against this box's libssl 3.0.13, and end to end against the pre-fix
///     build, where every retry still failed with its own error and never the residue;
///   - an ESTABLISHED connection is not: its next SSL_read that merely needs more bytes is
///     classified from the queue first, so the residue turns "want read" into a fatal
///     SSL_ERROR_SSL and a healthy pooled connection dies. Verified against libssl directly:
///     the same blocked read classifies 2 (WANT_READ) on a clean queue and 1 (SSL_ERROR_SSL)
///     with only the residue planted.
///
/// So the regression pin here drives the real victim: an established connection that must survive
/// a neighbouring connection's failed-handshake teardown. The recovery tests around it pin the
/// rest of the behaviour and say what they do NOT pin.
