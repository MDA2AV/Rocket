/// The client's own posture knobs: protocol floor, ALPN, and where its trust comes from. Each test
/// asserts the option TOOK EFFECT on the wire - a peer outside the stated posture is turned away
/// while one inside it is served - not that setting it was accepted.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Two live defects ride as Pending:
///
///   - BuildAlpnWire casts each UTF-16 unit to a byte, so a non-ASCII protocol name is OFFERED as
///     a different protocol made of its chars' low bytes - the client twin of the server-side
///     defect in TlsService.BuildAlpnWire, proven there today;
///   - HandshakeTimeoutMs is only checked between handshake flights, so the one peer a handshake
///     timeout exists for - accepted the connect, then went silent - is not bounded by it at all.
///
/// Examined without a failing result, stated so they are not re-litigated: MinimumVersion = 0 is
/// accepted (OpenSSL's "no floor"), but this box's system-wide MinProtocol makes the weakened
/// floor unobservable, so no test can discriminate it here; a ServerName over 255 bytes makes the
/// unchecked SNI ctrl silently send no SNI, but SSL_set1_host still checks the certificate against
/// the full name, so every reachable outcome fails safe; and the client has no in-memory CA
/// source, so the file/in-memory equivalence question the server answers cannot arise.
